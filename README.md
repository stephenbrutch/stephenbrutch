# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Look through the sections below:

## 1. Repository Summaries
1. For general notes on physics informed/inverse physics informed neural networks (PINNS/IPINNS) click [go to repository](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/PINNS-and-IPINNS)
   
2. For more specific notes/codes on my Graduate Research with the Advanced Dynamics and Controls Laboratory at ERAU related to deep learning approaches towards physics informed human pilot behavior and physics informed pilot parameter estimation click [go to repository](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Pilot-Models-for-Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks) .

   - In this repo I have my notes on the problem formulations and analysis as well as links to view the google colab codes. The google colab links are the raw codes I use
   
4. For Python machine learning codes that I used from coding tutorial online to learn, click [go to repository](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Python-Machine-Learning-Codes).
   - In this repo I went over the basics of Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scit-kit Learn), Tensorflow (regression, classification), Pytorch (classificication, computer vision, building custom datasets/datalaoders for multiclass classification) 
   
5. For machine learning projects that use Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow click [got to repository](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Machine-Learning-Projects)
   
6. For Navigation and Controls related work click [go to repository](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/GNC-HWS-Projects)
